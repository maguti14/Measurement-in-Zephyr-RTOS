Measurements
############

Overview
********
This program measures interrupt latency and context switching overhead in Zephyr RTOS.
on the Galileo Gen 2 Board. Interrupts are generated by configuring an input GPIO pin
and another output GPIO pin. The output pin generates an output signal to the input pin
which has interrupt enabled at the rising edge. On the board, I have connected the pins
IO3 and IO10 together with a cable. (Please refer to the image on the report).
For context switching priority threads and semaphores are used to measure both the latency
of just a system call and the latency of both a call and a context switch which occurs when
a lower priority thread releases a resource to a higher priority thread. Background
computing is also added in the form of a message passing system between two threads to
measure the effects it has on interrupt latency. Finally, a shell module named "measure"
is provided so that the user may input commands to print the results stored in buffers.

Building and Running
********************

To build this project on Ubuntu 16, in the build directory I used:

$ cmake -GNinja -DBOARD=galileo ..
$ ninja

Usage
======

To use the code wait until the measurements are done and you get this output:

"Measurements done! You may now issue shell commands!"

Then, hit ENTER and select the custom shell module provided:

=> select measure

Finally, use the the commands to retrieve the respective set of measurements:

/* To Print latencies with no background computing.*/
=> latency

/* To Print latencies with background computing.*/
=> latencyBusy

/* To Print context switching overhead.*/
=> contextSwitch

You can always type in "help" for infromation.

***Note: I get a warning but that is for the patch applied to Zephyr, not from my source code.
